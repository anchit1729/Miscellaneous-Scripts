# Miscellaneous-Scripts
A collection of scripts I wrote during the implementation of certain projects I made.

The first script is a simple image downloader that I've often used while implementing Computer Vision projects.

The second script is a utility script that I wrote for my father when he faced language-related issues working with German clients. The script's functionality
simply involves translating the contents of a spreadsheet to English.
